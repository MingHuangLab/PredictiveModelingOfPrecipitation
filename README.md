# Predictive Modeling of Precipitation (R)

End-to-end precipitation prediction project using R for data wrangling, visualization, and regression modeling.

## Notebook (Gist)
https://gist.github.com/MingHuangLab/e181132bbcc23932efde18d64f3255ae

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for analyzing and predicting daily precipitation using R. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and interpretation in a reproducible notebook.

## R Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`
- Time-series trend exploration and descriptive statistics
- Regression modeling (`lm`), model diagnostics, and performance evaluation
- Feature engineering and preprocessing techniques
- Reproducible notebook workflow with clear code annotations

## Modeling Summary
The notebook builds and evaluates a regression model to predict precipitation levels from weather variables. Evaluation metrics include RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. Visualizations and diagnostics are included to assess model performance.

## Key R Packages
```
dplyr
tidyr
ggplot2
readr
lubridate
stats
```

## How to Run
Clone the repository and open the notebook in RStudio or a Jupyter environment with an R kernel. Install required packages using:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "lubridate"))
```

Run the notebook cells from top to bottom to reproduce the analysis.
